It seems like you're on the right track, but there's a small misunderstanding. The calculation 20/10 = 2 is actually the amount of beeswax needed to make 20 candles, not the profit per candle. So, Charlie needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles. Can you try again to calculate the total cost of the beeswax and then calculate the net profit? Remember, each pound of beeswax costs $10.00 and each candle is sold for $2.00.

Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Let g be the number of geese and let s be the number of sheep. The farm has g + s = 20 animals.
Therefore Lee has s = 20 - g sheep.
The animals have 2g + 4s = 70 legs.
Using the value of s above, 2g + 4(20-g) = 70.
2g + 80 - 4g = 70.
2g = 10.
There are therefore 10/2 = 5 geese.
There are 20 - 5 = 15 sheep remaining on the farm.
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Let g be the number of geese and let s be the number of sheep. The farm has g + s = 20 animals.
