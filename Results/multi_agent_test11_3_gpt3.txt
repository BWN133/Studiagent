Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: The ticket costs 109 - 5 = $104 for each child. So the ticket cost of the two children is 104 x 2 = $208. The couple needs to pay the regular price, so it's 109 x 2 = $218. Thus, the family needs to pay a total of 208 + 218 = $426. Therefore, their change is 500 - 426 = $74.
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Step 1: Calculate the total cost for the couple.
- Regular ticket price is $109.
- Children below 12 years old have a $5 discount.
- Total cost = 2 children * ($109 - $5) + 2 adults * $109 = $218 + $218 = $436
