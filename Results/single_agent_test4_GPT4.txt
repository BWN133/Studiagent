Mrs. Snyder used to spend 40 percent of her monthly income on rent and utilities. Her salary was recently increased by $600 so now her rent and utilities only amount to 25 percent of her monthly income. How much was her previous monthly income?
content='Your approach is a bit off. Your assumption that the original salary is x, and 40 percent of it is 40x, is incorrect. 40 percent of x would be 0.4x, not 40x. Also, your equation x+600 = 0.25 *0.4x is not correct. The correct equation should be based on the cost of rent and utilities before and after the salary increase. Try to fix these issues.'

content='It seems like you made a little mistake in your equation. The 40% of her original salary x, or 0.4x, represents her original rent and utilities expenses. After her salary raise, this amount is now 25% of her new salary (x + $600). So the equation should be 0.4x = 0.25*(x + $600). Try solving this equation to find her original salary.'

content="You're close, but there seems to be a mistake in your calculation. You correctly assumed her original salary as x, and 40% of it would indeed be 0.4x. However, the equation should be 0.4x = 0.25*(x+600) because the cost of her rent and utilities remains the same before and after her salary increase. Try to solve this equation."

content="I appreciate your effort but it seems like there is a mistake in setting up your equation. You're right in saying that we assume her original salary is x and 40 percent of the salary is 0.4x. However, after the raise, her salary becomes x+600 and her rent and utilities are now 25 percent of her new salary. So, the equation should look like this: 0.4x = 0.25 (x+600). Try to solve this equation for x again."

content="It seems like you've mixed up some parts of the calculation. You're correct in letting her original salary be x and that 40% of her original salary is 0.4x. However, this 0.4x is the same amount as 25% of her new salary (x+600). So the equation should be 0.4x = 0.25 * (x+600). Try solving this equation!"

content='It seems like you\'ve made a logical mistake in forming your equation. You\'ve correctly identified that her initial salary should be represented by "x". Her expenses were 40% of this initial salary, which would be 0.4x, not 40x. \n\nAfter the raise, her salary is (x+600). But then you\'ve mentioned that this is equal to 25% of 40% of her original salary, which is not right. \n\nThe cost of her rent and utilities (which was originally 40% of her salary) is now 25% of her new salary.
