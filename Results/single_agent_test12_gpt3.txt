content="I can help you solve the problem step by step. Let's start by letting her previous monthly income be p. Then we can represent the cost of her rent and utilities as 40 percent of p, which is (40/100)*p = 2p/5. Her income was increased by $600, so it is now p+$600. The cost of her rent and utilities now amounts to 25 percent of (p+$600), which is (25/100)*(p+$600) = (p+$600)/4. Equating both expressions for the cost of rent and utilities, we get 2p/5 = (p+$600)/4. Can you continue from here?"
