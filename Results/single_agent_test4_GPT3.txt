Mrs. Snyder used to spend 40 percent of her monthly income on rent and utilities. Her salary was recently increased by $600 so now her rent and utilities only amount to 25 percent of her monthly income. How much was her previous monthly income?
content='The equation you wrote seems a bit off. It should represent the fact that 40% of her original income was spent on rent and utilities, and after the raise, this expense decreased to 25% of her new income. Try setting up the equation using these details and see if you get the same result. Remember, the equation should represent the relationship between her original income and the increase after the raise. Keep going!'

content='Good job! You correctly set up the equation to solve for the previous monthly income. However, it seems like there might be a small mistake in your equation. I think it should be x + 600 = 0.25 * (x + 600) instead of 0.25 * 0.4x. Can you double-check that part?'
