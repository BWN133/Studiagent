Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Studying for her test, Mitchell had read ten chapters of a book before 4 o'clock. When it clocked 4, Mitchell had read 20 pages of the 11th chapter of the book she was studying from. After 4 o'clock, she didn't read the remaining pages of chapter eleven but proceeded and read 2 more chapters of the book. If each chapter in the book had 40 pages, calculate the total number of pages that Mitchell had read altogether?
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Since each chapter of the book has 40 pages, Mitchell had read 10*40 = 400 pages from the first ten chapters.
After reading 20 pages of the eleventh chapter, the total number of pages that Mitchell had read is 400+20 = 420
The next two chapters that she read had 2*40 = 80 pages.
In total, Mitchell read 420+80 = 500 pages of the book that day.
#### 500
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Mitchell read 10 chapters of the book before 4 o'clock, which are 10 * 40 = 400 pages.
She then read 20 pages of chapter 11, which means she still had 40 - 20 = 20 pages left in chapter 11.
After 4 o'clock, she didn't read the remaining 20 pages of chapter 11, but instead read 2 more chapters, which is 2 * 40 = 80 pages.
Therefore, the total number of pages that Mitchell read altogether is 400 + 80 = 480 pages.

What was the total amount of money required to film Janet's entire newest film?
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: The first movie was 2*60=120 minutes
So this movie is 120*.6=72 minutes longer
So this movie is 192 minutes
It also cost 50*2=$100 per minute to film
So it cost 192*100=$19200
#### 19200
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Step 1: Let's first find the duration of Janet's new movie.
Given that the new movie is 60% longer than her previous 2-hour movie, we calculate 60% of 2 hours:
60% of 2 = 0.60 * 2 = 1.2 hours longer than the previous movie.
So, the duration of the new movie = 2 hours + 1.2 hours = 3.2 hours.

Step 2: Now, let's calculate the cost to film Janet's new movie.
Her previous movie cost $50 per minute, so the cost of filming the previous 2-hour movie is:
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour * $50/minute = $6000

The newest movie cost twice as much per minute to film as the previous movie, so the cost per minute for the new movie is $50 * 2 = $100.

To find the total amount required to film the entire newest film, we calculate:
3.2 hours * 60 minutes/hour * $100/minute = $19200

Total crayons = 5 boxes * 24 crayons per box = 120 crayons

Step 2: Next, we calculate how many crayons were unused in the first 2 boxes.
Unused crayons in 2 boxes = 5/8 * 2 boxes * 24 crayons per box = 30 crayons

Step 3: Then, we calculate how many crayons were used in the other 2 boxes.
Used crayons in 2 boxes = 2/3 * 2 boxes * 24 crayons per box = 32 crayons

Step 4: Now, we find out how many crayons were unused in the last box.
Unused crayons in the last box = Total crayons - Unused crayons in the first 2 boxes - Used crayons in the other 2 boxes
Unused crayons in the last box = 120 crayons - 30 crayons - 32 crayons = 58 crayons

Step 5: Finally, we calculate the total number of unused crayons.
Total unused crayons = Unused crayons in the first 2 boxes + Unused crayons in the last box
Total unused crayons = 30 crayons + 58 crayons = 88 crayons

The correct number of unused crayons in the first 2 boxes is 30 instead of 15.'You've made a small misunderstanding. When the problem states that 5/8 of the crayons in the 2 boxes were not yet used, it means that 15 crayons in each of these 2 boxes were unused. So, the total unused crayons in these 2 boxes is 15 crayons/box * 2 boxes = 30 crayons, not 15.

Additionally, in the other 2 boxes, there are 24 * (2/3) = 16 used crayons in each box, which means there are 24 - 16 = 8 unused crayons in each box, and a total of 8 crayons/box * 2 boxes = 16 unused crayons in these 2 boxes.

The last box is untouched, so it has all 24 crayons unused.

Now, try to recalculate the total number of unused crayons considering these corrections.

Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Melody planted sunflowers from two different seed packets. She found that the sunflowers from Packet A were 20% taller than the sunflowers from Packet B. If the sunflowers from Packet A were 192 inches tall, how tall were the sunflowers from Packet B?
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: The height of the sunflowers from Packet A is the same as the height of the sunflowers from Packet B + 20%. If Y represents the height of the sunflowers from Packet B, Y + 0.20Y = the height of sunflowers from Packet A.
We know the height of the sunflowers from Packet A is 192 inches = Y + 0.20Y or 1.2Y.
To figure out Y, we would divide both sides of the equation by 1.2, like this: 192 / 1.2 = 1.2Y / 1.2 or 160 = Y.

Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Step 1: First, we need to determine how much taller the sunflowers from Packet A are compared to Packet B. Since Packet A is 20% taller than Packet B, we can calculate the height difference between the two packets:
Height Difference = 192 * 20% = 192 * 0.20 = 38.4 inches

Step 2: Now, we know that the sunflowers from Packet A are 192 inches tall. To find the height of the sunflowers from Packet B, we need to subtract the height difference from the sunflowers in Packet A:
Height of sunflowers from Packet B = 192 - 38.4 = 153.6 inches

Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Sansa is a famous artist, she can draw a portrait and sell it according to its size. She sells an 8-inch portrait for $5, and a 16-inch portrait for twice the price of the 8-inch portrait. If she sells three 8-inch portraits and five 16-inch portraits per day, how many does she earns every 3 days?
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Sansa earns $5 x 3 = $15 every day by selling three 8-inch portraits.
The price of the 16-inch portrait is $5 x 2 = $10 each.
So, she earns $10 x 5 = $50 every day by selling five 16-inch portraits.
Her total earnings is $50 + $15 = $65 every day.
Therefore, the total amount she earns after 3 days is $65 x 3 = $195.
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Step 1: Calculate the total earnings per day for 8-inch and 16-inch portraits.
- For 8-inch portraits: $5 * 3 = $15 per day
- For 16-inch portraits: $5 * 2 * 16 * 5 = $160 per day

Step 2: Calculate the total earnings per 3 days.
- Total earnings for 8-inch portraits in 3 days: $15 * 3 = $45
- Total earnings for 16-inch portraits in 3 days: $160 * 3 = $480

Step 3: Add the earnings from both sizes.
- Total earnings in 3 days: $45 + $480 = $525

Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Last year Jessica paid $1000 for rent, $200 for food, and $100 for car insurance each month. This year her rent goes up by 30%, food costs increase by 50%, and the cost of her car insurance triples because she was at fault in an accident. How much more does Jessica pay for her expenses over the whole year compared to last year?
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: First find the increase in rent by multiplying last year's rent by 30%: $1000 * .3 = $300
Then find the food cost increase by multiplying last year's costs by 50%: $200 * .5 = $100
Then find the new car insurance price by multiplying last year's price by 3: $100 * 3 = $300
Then subtract the cost of car insurance last year from this year's price to find the increase: $300 - $100 = $200
Now find how much Jessica's monthly expenses increased by adding the increases in each of the three costs: $300 + $100 + $200 = $600
Now multiply the increase per month by the number of months in a year to find the annual increase: $600/month * 12 months/year = $7200/year
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Step 1: Calculate the increase in each expense

- Rent: 30% increase on $1000 = $1000 * 0.30 = $300 increase
- Food: 50% increase on $200 = $200 * 0.50 = $100 increase
- Car Insurance: Triples from $100 to $100 * 3 = $300 increase

Step 2: Find the new expenses for each category

- Rent: $1000 + $300 = $1300 per month
- Food: $200 + $100 = $300 per month
- Car Insurance: $100 + $300 = $400 per month

Step 3: Find the total increase in monthly expenses

- $1300 (Rent) + $300 (Food) + $400 (Car Insurance) = $2000 per month

Step 4: Calculate the total increase per year compared to last year

- $2000 per month * 12 months = $24000 per year

Practicing 48 hours a day isn't practically possible because there are only 24 hours in a day. We need to find out how many hours Randy needs to practice each day from Monday to Friday.

Remember, Randy plans to take 2 weeks off for vacation each year and there are 52 weeks in a year. So, he practices for 52 weeks - 2 weeks = 50 weeks, not 42.

And since Randy practices 5 days a week (Monday through Friday), the total number of practice days in a year would be 50 weeks * 5 days = 250 days.

Now, try to find out how many hours a day Randy needs to practice by dividing the total hours (10,000) by the total number of practice days over the 8 years.

So Mr. Montero needs 20 gallons/set x 3 sets = 60 gallons in all.
Since his car has 8 gallons already, then he needs to add 60 gallons - 8 gallons = 52 gallons more.
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Step 1: Calculate how many gallons of gas are needed to travel 600 miles round trip.
- Since the car uses 20 gallons of gas to travel 400 miles, the rate is 20 gallons / 400 miles = 1 gallon per 20 miles.
- To travel 600 miles round trip, Mr. Montero's car would need 600 miles / 20 miles per gallon = 30 gallons.

Step 2: Calculate how many more gallons of gas Mr. Montero needs.
- Mr. Montero's car already has 8 gallons.
- Therefore, Mr. Montero needs 30 gallons - 8 gallons = 22 gallons more.

Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: A company has 200 employees. 60% of the employees drive to work. Of the employees who don't drive to work, half take public transportation. How many more employees drive to work than take public transportation?
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Drive to work:200(.60)=120
Don't Drive to work:200-120=80
Public Transportation:80(.50)=40 employees
80-40=40 employees
#### 40
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Step 1: Calculate the number of employees who drive to work.
60% of 200 employees = 0.60 * 200 = 120 employees drive to work.

Step 2: Calculate the number of employees who don't drive to work.
200 employees - 120 employees = 80 employees don't drive to work.

Step 3: Calculate the number of employees who don't drive to work and take public transportation.
Half of the employees who don't drive take public transportation.
80 employees / 2 = 40 employees take public transportation.

Step 4: Find the difference between the number of employees who drive to work and those who take public transportation.
120 employees (drive) - 40 employees (public transportation) = 80
