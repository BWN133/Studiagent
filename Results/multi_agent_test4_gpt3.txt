Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Let her previous monthly income be p
The cost of her rent and utilities was 40 percent of p which is (40/100)*p = 2p/5
Her income was increased by $600 so it is now p+$600
The cost of her rent and utilities now amount to 25 percent of (p+$600) which is (25/100)*(p+$600) = (p+$600)/4
Equating both expressions for cost of rent and utilities: 2p/5 = (p+$600)/4
Multiplying both sides of the equation by 20 gives 8p = 5p+$3000
Subtracting 5p from both sides gives: 3p = $3000
Dividing both sides by 3 gives p = $1000

When you say 40 percent of the salary, it should be 0.4x, not 40x. Can you try to correct this and solve the problem again?

The cost of her rent and utilities was 40 percent of p which is (40/100)*p = 2p/5

Given that Mrs. Snyder initially spent 40% of her salary on rent and utilities, we can represent this as 0.4x. After the raise, her salary is x + $600 and she now spends 25% on rent and utilities. This can be represented as 0.25(x + $600).

You should equate 40% of the original salary to 25% of the increased salary. So the equation should be 0.4x = 0.25 * (x + 600). Try to solve it again with this equation.

Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Let her previous monthly income be p
The cost of her rent and utilities was 40 percent of p which is (40/100)*p = 2p/5
Her income was increased by $600 so it is now p+$600
The cost of her rent and utilities now amount to 25 percent of (p+$600) which is (25/100)*(p+$600) = (p+$600)/4
Equating both expressions for cost of rent and utilities: 2p/5 = (p+$600)/4
Multiplying both sides of the equation by 20 gives 8p = 5p+$3000
Subtracting 5p from both sides gives: 3p = $3000
Dividing both sides by 3 gives p = $1000
