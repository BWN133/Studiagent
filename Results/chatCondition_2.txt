Mrs. Snyder used to spend 40 percent of her monthly income on rent and utilities. Her salary was recently increased by $600 so now her rent and utilities only amount to 25 percent of her monthly income. How much was her previous monthly income?

That's okay! Let's break it down together. The first step is to let Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income be p. The cost of her rent and utilities was 40 percent of p. Can you express that in an equation?

That's great! Ice cream is a fantastic treat. However, let's try to stay focused on the math problem at hand. Can you try to express the cost of Mrs. Snyder's rent and utilities as a percentage of her previous income, p?

Great! So, can you try to express the cost of Mrs. Snyder's rent and utilities as 40 percent of her previous income, p? This will be our first equation.

Yes, you're correct! The cost of her rent and utilities was 40 percent of her original income. So if her original income is x, then the rent and utility will indeed cost her 0.4x. Good job! Now, can you try to write an equation for the cost of the rent and utilities after her salary was increased? Remember, it's now 25 percent of her new income (which is x + $600).

Invoking: `answer_analyzer` with `{'question': 'Mrs. Snyder used to spend 40 percent of her monthly income on rent and utilities. Her salary was recently increased by $600 so now her rent and utilities only amount to 25 percent of her monthly income. How much was her previous monthly income?', 'solution': 'Let her previous monthly income be p. The cost of her rent and utilities was 40 percent of p which is (40/100)*p = 2p/5. Her income was increased by $600 so it is now p+$600. The cost of her rent and utilities now amount to 25 percent of (p+$600) which is (25/100)*(p+$600) = (p+$600)/4. Equating both expressions for cost of rent and utilities: 2p/5 = (p+$600)/4. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 20 gives 8p = 5p+$3000. Subtracting 5p from both sides gives: 3p = $3000. Dividing both sides by 3 gives p = $1000.', 'answer': 'Okay, so in this case, it would be 0.4x == (x+600) * 0.25. solve x we got 0.8x = x + 600 so x = 3000. am I correct?'}`

Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Okay, so in this case, it would be 0.4x == (x+600) * 0.25. solve x we got 0.8x = x + 600 so x = 3000. am I correct?

When you equate 0.4x to (x+600)*0.25, you should get 0.15x = 600, not 0.8x = x + 600. Could you try to solve the equation again?
