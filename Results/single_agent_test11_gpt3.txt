content="I see. Let's start by understanding the problem together. Mrs. Snyder used to spend 40 percent of her monthly income on rent and utilities. Her salary was recently increased by $600 so now her rent and utilities only amount to 25 percent of her monthly income. We want to find out how much her previous monthly income was. Do you have any specific questions about the problem?"
content='It seems like you might be feeling a bit lost. Let\'s try breaking down the problem step by step. Firstly, we can let her previous monthly income be represented by "p". Then, we can calculate the cost of her rent and utilities using this value. Does that make sense so far? If you have any questions or need clarification, feel free to ask!'
content='Great! So, the first step is to let her previous monthly income be represented by "p". Then, the cost of her rent and utilities was 40 percent of p, which is (40/100)*p = 2p/5. \n\nHer income was increased by $600, so now it is p + $600.\n\nThe cost of her rent and utilities now amount to 25 percent of (p + $600), which is (25/100)*(p + $600) = (p + $600)/4.\n\nWe can then equate both expressions for the cost of rent and utilities: 2p/5 = (p + $600)/4.\n\nCould you try solving the equation and find the value of p, which represents her previous monthly income?'
content='Let her previous monthly income be "p".\nThe cost of her rent and utilities was 40 percent of p which is (40/100)*p = 2p/5.\nHer income was increased by $600 so it is now p+$600.\nThe cost of her rent and utilities now amount to 25 percent of (p+$600) which is (25/100)*(p+$600) = (p+$600)/4.\nEquating both expressions for the cost of rent and utilities: 2p/5 = (p+$600)/4.\nTry to solve for p using this equation. Remember, the goal is to isolate p. Can you give it a try?'
