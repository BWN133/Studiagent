Mrs. Snyder used to spend 40 percent of her monthly income on rent and utilities. Her salary was recently increased by $600 so now her rent and utilities only amount to 25 percent of her monthly income. How much was her previous monthly income?
content="You've made a mistake in your calculations. You correctly started off by stating that 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, so to make 20 candles, Charlie would need 2 pounds of beeswax. However, then you switched to calculating the earnings per candle, which is not the right step in this context. Instead, you should first calculate the total cost of the beeswax and wicks Charlie needs to make the 20 candles. Do you know how to do that?"
content="You're correct that John eats 2 cups of mushrooms a day and that gives him 6 grams of protein per day. But the question asks for the amount of protein he gets per week. Do you know how to find that?"
content="You made a minor error in your calculation. You correctly calculated the cost of the basketballs as 8 * 14 = 112, not 100. But you made a mistake while calculating the cost of the baseballs. It should be 9 * 3 = 27, not 24. Therefore, you need to recalculate the difference between the basketball coach's spending and the baseball coach's spending."
content="You've made a couple of mistakes in your calculations. You correctly calculated Tim's original yearly salary and his new monthly salary. However, the bonus is half a month of his new salary, not his original salary. Also, the 5% raise has already been included in the calculation of the new monthly salary. Therefore, you need to recalculate Tim's total yearly income, considering his new monthly salary and his bonus. Can you try again?"
content="That's correct! Now, can you figure out how old Steve's son is?"
content="You've made a small mistake in your calculation. You correctly identified the steps needed to solve the problem, but there was an error in your computation. When you multiply 12 by 4.5, the result is not 60 miles. Can you try calculating it again?"
content="It seems like you've made a mistake in understanding the problem. Sally's bank account balance increased from $200 to $420, which means she received some money. This is her wage for the week. You need to compare this with her usual weekly wage to find out how much was withheld. Can you try again?"
content="You're almost there! You've correctly figured out that Mike will finish reading the book in 20 days. However, the deadline is in 30 days, not 31. Can you try calculating how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading again?"
content="You've made a small mistake in your calculation. You correctly identified the steps needed to solve the problem, but there was an error in your computation. When you calculate the cost of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, then subtract the cost of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, the result should not be $13. Can you try calculating it again?"
content="You've made a minor error in your calculation. After finding out that there are 5 geese, you should subtract this number from the total number of animals, which is 20. However, you calculated 20 - 5 as 14 instead of 15. Therefore, there should be 15 sheep on the farm, not 14. Can you try again?"
