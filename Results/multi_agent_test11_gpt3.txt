Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: The ticket costs 109 - 5 = $104 for each child. So the ticket cost of the two children is 104 x 2 = $208. The couple needs to pay the regular price, so it's 109 x 2 = $218. Thus, the family needs to pay a total of 208 + 218 = $426. Therefore, their change is 500 - 426 = $74.
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Step 1: Calculate the total cost for the couple.
- Regular ticket price is $109.
- Children below 12 years old have a $5 discount.
- Total cost = 2 children * ($109 - $5) + 2 adults * $109 = $218 + $218 = $436

Step 2: Subtract the total cost from the amount given to the cashier.
- Change = $500 - $436 = $64

Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: He splits the cost 3+1=4 ways
100 pounds of burgers at $3 per pound makes 100*3=$300
In addition to $80 for condiments and propane the total cost was 300+80=$380

They buy 100 pounds of burgers at $3 per pound, so the total cost for burgers is 100 * 3 = $300.

They also buy $80 of condiments and propane.

John buys all the alcohol which costs $200.

Adding all the costs together, John's total expenditure is 300 (burgers) + 80 (condiments and propane) + 200 (alcohol) = $580.

Therefore, the total amount she earns after 3 days is $65 x 3 = $195.', 'answer': 'Step 1: Calculate the total earnings per day for 8-inch and 16-inch portraits.\n- For 8-inch portraits: $5 * 3 = $15 per day\n- For 16-inch portraits: $5 * 2 * 16 * 5 = $160 per day\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total earnings per 3 days.\n- Total earnings for 8-inch portraits in 3 days: $15 * 3 = $45\n- Total earnings for 16-inch portraits in 3 days: $160 * 3 = $480\n\nStep 3: Add the earnings from both sizes.\n- Total earnings in 3 days: $45 + $480 = $525'}`


Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Sansa sells three 8-inch portraits and five 16-inch portraits per day. How much does she earn every 3 days?
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Sansa earns $5 x 3 = $15 every day by selling three 8-inch portraits. The price of the 16-inch portrait is $5 x 2 = $10 each. So, she earns $10 x 5 = $50 every day by selling five 16-inch portraits. Her total earnings is $50 + $15 = $65 every day. Therefore, the total amount she earns after 3 days is $65 x 3 = $195.
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Step 1: Calculate the total earnings per day for 8-inch and 16-inch portraits.
- For 8-inch portraits: $5 * 3 = $15 per day
- For 16-inch portraits: $5 * 2 * 16 * 5 = $160 per day

Step 2: Calculate the total earnings per 3 days.
- Total earnings for 8-inch portraits in 3 days: $15 * 3 = $45
- Total earnings for 16-inch portraits in 3 days: $160 * 3 = $480

Step 3: Add the earnings from both sizes.

Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Last year Jessica paid $1000 for rent, $200 for food, and $100 for car insurance each month. This year her rent goes up by 30%, food costs increase by 50%, and the cost of her car insurance triples because she was at fault in an accident. How much more does Jessica pay for her expenses over the whole year compared to last year?
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: First find the increase in rent by multiplying last year's rent by 30%: $1000 * .3 = $300
Then find the food cost increase by multiplying last year's costs by 50%: $200 * .5 = $100
Then find the new car insurance price by multiplying last year's price by 3: $100 * 3 = $300
Then subtract the cost of car insurance last year from this year's price to find the increase: $300 - $100 = $200
Now find how much Jessica's monthly expenses increased by adding the increases in each of the three costs: $300 + $100 + $200 = $600
Now multiply the increase per month by the number of months in a year to find the annual increase: $600/month * 12 months/year = $7200/year
