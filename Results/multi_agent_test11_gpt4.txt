Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Studying for her test, Mitchell had read ten chapters of a book before 4 o'clock. When it clocked 4, Mitchell had read 20 pages of the 11th chapter of the book she was studying from. After 4 o'clock, she didn't read the remaining pages of chapter eleven but proceeded and read 2 more chapters of the book. If each chapter in the book had 40 pages, calculate the total number of pages that Mitchell had read altogether?
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Since each chapter of the book has 40 pages, Mitchell had read 10*40 = 400 pages from the first ten chapters.
After reading 20 pages of the eleventh chapter, the total number of pages that Mitchell had read is 400+20 = 420
The next two chapters that she read had 2*40 = 80 pages.
In total, Mitchell read 420+80 = 500 pages of the book that day.
#### 500
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Mitchell read 10 chapters of the book before 4 o'clock, which are 10 * 40 = 400 pages.
She then read 20 pages of chapter 11, which means she still had 40 - 20 = 20 pages left in chapter 11.
After 4 o'clock, she didn't read the remaining 20 pages of chapter 11, but instead read 2 more chapters, which is 2 * 40 = 80 pages.
Therefore, the total number of pages that Mitchell read altogether is 400 + 80 = 480 pages.

Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: A couple with two children, ages 6 and 10 years old, decided to go to an amusement park. The regular ticket costs $109, but children below 12 years old have a $5 discount. If they gave the cashier $500, how much change will they receive?
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: The ticket costs 109 - 5 = $104 for each child.
So the ticket cost of the two children is 104 x 2 = $208.
The couple needs to pay the regular price, so it's 109 x 2 = $218.
Thus, the family needs to pay a total of 208 + 218 = $426.
Therefore, their change is 500 - 426 = $74.
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Step 1: Calculate the total cost for the couple.
- Regular ticket price is $109.
- Children below 12 years old have a $5 discount.
- Total cost = 2 children * ($109 - $5) + 2 adults * $109 = $218 + $218 = $436

Step 2: Subtract the total cost from the amount given to the cashier.
- Change = $500 - $436 = $64

Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Janet filmed a new movie that is 60% longer than her previous 2-hour long movie.  Her previous movie cost $50 per minute to film, and the newest movie cost twice as much per minute to film as the previous movie.  What was the total amount of money required to film Janet's entire newest film?
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: The first movie was 2*60=120 minutes
So this movie is 120*.6=72 minutes longer
So this movie is 192 minutes
It also cost 50*2=$100 per minute to film
So it cost 192*100=$19200
#### 19200
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Step 1: Let's first find the duration of Janet's new movie.
Given that the new movie is 60% longer than her previous 2-hour movie, we calculate 60% of 2 hours:
60% of 2 = 0.60 * 2 = 1.2 hours longer than the previous movie.
So, the duration of the new movie = 2 hours + 1.2 hours = 3.2 hours.

Step 2: Now, let's calculate the cost to film Janet's new movie.
Her previous movie cost $50 per minute, so the cost of filming the previous 2-hour movie is:
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour * $50/minute = $6000

The newest movie cost twice as much per minute to film as the previous movie, so the cost per minute for the new movie is $50 * 2 = $100.

To find the total amount required to film the entire newest film, we calculate:
3.2 hours * 60 minutes/hour * $100/minute = $19200

Used crayons in 2 boxes = 2/3 * 2 boxes * 24 crayons per box = 32 crayons. Step 4: Now, we find out how many crayons were unused in the last box. Unused crayons in the last box = Total crayons - Unused crayons in the first 2 boxes - Used crayons in the other 2 boxes. Unused crayons in the last box = 120 crayons - 30 crayons - 32 crayons = 58 crayons. Step 5: Finally, we calculate the total number of unused crayons. Total unused crayons = Unused crayons in the first 2 boxes + Unused crayons in the last box. Total unused crayons = 30 crayons + 58 crayons = 88 crayons.'}`


Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Madeline has 5 boxes with 24 crayons in each. She noticed that 5/8 of the crayons in the 2 boxes were not yet used. In the 2 other boxes, only 2/3 of the crayons were used while the last box was not entirely used. How many unused crayons did Madeline have?
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Two boxes of crayons have 24 x 5/8 = 15 unused crayons from each box. So, a total of 15 x 2 = 30 unused crayons are in the two boxes. For the other 2 boxes, there are 24 x 2/3 = 16 used crayons from each box. Hence, there are 24 - 16 = 8 unused crayons. So, a total of 8 x 2 = 16 unused crayons are in the other two boxes. Therefore, Madeline has a total of 30 + 16 + 24 = 70 unused crayons.
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Step 1: First, we calculate the total number of crayons in all 5 boxes. Total crayons = 5 boxes * 24 crayons per box = 120 crayons. Step 2: Next, we calculate how many crayons were unused in the first 2 boxes. Unused crayons in 2 boxes = 5/8 * 2 boxes * 24 crayons per box = 30 crayons.

Unused crayons in the last box = 120 crayons - 30 crayons - 32 crayons = 58 crayons. Step 5: Finally, we calculate the total number of unused crayons. Total unused crayons = Unused crayons in the first 2 boxes + Unused crayons in the last box. Total unused crayons = 30 crayons + 58 crayons = 88 crayons.

Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Sansa is a famous artist, she can draw a portrait and sell it according to its size. She sells an 8-inch portrait for $5, and a 16-inch portrait for twice the price of the 8-inch portrait. If she sells three 8-inch portraits and five 16-inch portraits per day, how many does she earns every 3 days?
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Sansa earns $5 x 3 = $15 every day by selling three 8-inch portraits.
The price of the 16-inch portrait is $5 x 2 = $10 each.
So, she earns $10 x 5 = $50 every day by selling five 16-inch portraits.
Her total earnings is $50 + $15 = $65 every day.
Therefore, the total amount she earns after 3 days is $65 x 3 = $195.
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Step 1: Calculate the total earnings per day for 8-inch and 16-inch portraits.
- For 8-inch portraits: $5 * 3 = $15 per day
- For 16-inch portraits: $5 * 2 * 16 * 5 = $160 per day

Step 2: Calculate the total earnings per 3 days.
- Total earnings for 8-inch portraits in 3 days: $15 * 3 = $45
- Total earnings for 16-inch portraits in 3 days: $160 * 3 = $480

Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Last year Jessica paid $1000 for rent, $200 for food, and $100 for car insurance each month. This year her rent goes up by 30%, food costs increase by 50%, and the cost of her car insurance triples because she was at fault in an accident. How much more does Jessica pay for her expenses over the whole year compared to last year?
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: First find the increase in rent by multiplying last year's rent by 30%: $1000 * .3 = $300
Then find the food cost increase by multiplying last year's costs by 50%: $200 * .5 = $100
Then find the new car insurance price by multiplying last year's price by 3: $100 * 3 = $300
Then subtract the cost of car insurance last year from this year's price to find the increase: $300 - $100 = $200
Now find how much Jessica's monthly expenses increased by adding the increases in each of the three costs: $300 + $100 + $200 = $600
Now multiply the increase per month by the number of months in a year to find the annual increase: $600/month * 12 months/year = $7200/year
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Step 1: Calculate the increase in each expense

- Rent: 30% increase on $1000 = $1000 * 0.30 = $300 increase
- Food: 50% increase on $200 = $200 * 0.50 = $100 increase
- Car Insurance: Triples from $100 to $100 * 3 = $300 increase

Step 2: Find the new expenses for each category

- Rent: $1000 + $300 = $1300 per month
- Food: $200 + $100 = $300 per month
- Car Insurance: $100 + $300 = $400 per month

Step 3: Find the total increase in monthly expenses

- $1300 (Rent) + $300 (Food) + $400 (Car Insurance) = $2000 per month

Step 4: Calculate the total increase per year compared to last year

- $2000 per month * 12 months = $24000 per year

Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: A car uses 20 gallons of gas to travel 400 miles. Mr. Montero's car has 8 gallons in it. How many more gallons of gas does he need to travel 600 miles, back and forth?
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Mr. Montero is traveling a total distance of 600 miles + 600 miles = 1200 miles.
There are 1200 miles / 400 miles = 3 sets of 400 miles in 1200 miles.
So Mr. Montero needs 20 gallons/set x 3 sets = 60 gallons in all.
Since his car has 8 gallons already, then he needs to add 60 gallons - 8 gallons = 52 gallons more.
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Step 1: Calculate how many gallons of gas are needed to travel 600 miles round trip.
- Since the car uses 20 gallons of gas to travel 400 miles, the rate is 20 gallons / 400 miles = 1 gallon per 20 miles.
- To travel 600 miles round trip, Mr. Montero's car would need 600 miles / 20 miles per gallon = 30 gallons.

Step 2: Calculate how many more gallons of gas Mr. Montero needs.
- Mr. Montero's car already has 8 gallons.
- Therefore, Mr. Montero needs 30 gallons - 8 gallons = 22 gallons more.

You correctly figured out that the car uses 1 gallon per 20 miles. However, Mr. Montero is not just traveling 600 miles, he's traveling 600 miles back and forth, which is a total of 1200 miles. Try recalculating the amount of gas he needs with this correction.

You're on the right track, but there's a small mistake in your calculation. The price of two sandwiches for Bob is $3 in total, not $6. Therefore, the cost of Bob's fruit drink would be the total amount Andy spent minus the cost of Bob's sandwiches. Try recalculating the cost of Bob's fruit drink with this correction.

Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: A washing machine uses 20 gallons of water for a heavy wash, 10 gallons of water for a regular wash, and 2 gallons of water for a light wash per load of laundry. If bleach is used, there is an extra light wash cycle added to rinse the laundry thoroughly. There are two heavy washes, three regular washes, and one light wash to do. Two of the loads need to be bleached. How many gallons of water will be needed?
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: The two heavy washes will use 20 * 2 = 40 gallons of water.
The three regular washes will use 10 * 3 = 30 gallons of water.
The light wash will use 2 * 1 = 2 gallons of water.
The two bleached loads will use an extra 2 * 2 = 4 gallons of water.
In all, 40 + 30 + 2 + 4 = 76 gallons of water will be needed.
#### 76
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: 1. To calculate the total gallons of water needed, we first need to calculate the water used for each type of wash:
- Heavy wash: 20 gallons per load, and there are 2 loads, so total = 20 * 2 = 40 gallons
- Regular wash: 10 gallons per load, and there are 3 loads, so total = 10 * 3 = 30 gallons
- Light wash: 2 gallons per load, and there is 1 load, so total = 2 * 1 = 2 gallons

Now, we need to add the extra light wash cycles for the loads that need bleach. There are 2 loads that need to be bleached, so an extra 2 gallons of water will be needed.

Adding all these up: 40 gallons (heavy wash) + 30 gallons (regular wash) + 2 gallons (light wash) + 2 gallons (extra light wash for bleached loads) = 74 gallons

Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: A company has 200 employees.  60% of the employees drive to work.  Of the employees who don't drive to work, half take public transportation. How many more employees drive to work than take public transportation?
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Drive to work:200(.60)=120
Don't Drive to work:200-120=80
Public Transportation:80(.50)=40 employees
80-40=40 employees
#### 40
Answer analyzes triggered::::::::::::::: Step 1: Calculate the number of employees who drive to work.
60% of 200 employees = 0.60 * 200 = 120 employees drive to work.

Step 2: Calculate the number of employees who don't drive to work.
200 employees - 120 employees = 80 employees don't drive to work.

Step 3: Calculate the number of employees who don't drive to work and take public transportation.
Half of the employees who don't drive take public transportation.
80 employees / 2 = 40 employees take public transportation.

Step 4: Find the difference between the number of employees who drive to work and those who take public transportation.
120 employees (drive) - 40 employees (public transportation) = 80
