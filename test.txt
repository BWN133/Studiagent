Then her salary was increased by $600 so now her rent and utilities only amount to 25 percent of her monthly income. We want to find out how much her previous monthly income was. Does that make sense so far?"
content="I see. Let's take it one step at a time. First, we know that Mrs. Snyder used to spend 40 percent of her monthly income on rent and utilities. Then her salary was increased by $600 so now her rent and utilities only amount to 25 percent of her monthly income. We want to find out how much her previous monthly income was.

Mrs. Snyder used to spend 40 percent of her monthly income on rent and utilities. Her salary was recently increased by $600 so now her rent and utilities only amount to 25 percent of her monthly income. How much was her previous monthly income?
content="The equation you wrote seems a bit off. It looks like you're trying to set up an equation to solve for the original salary, but it's not quite correct. Try setting up the equation again and pay attention to how the different percentages of the salary are related. Let me know if you need a hint!"
content="It looks like you're on the right track now! However, when solving the equation 0.4x = 0.25(x + 600), be careful with the calculations. Double-check your steps and make sure to isolate the variable x correctly. Let me know if you need any further assistance!"
content='You made a conceptual mistake in setting up the equation. The equation should relate the original salary (let\'s call it "p") to the increase in salary and the change in the percentage of income spent on rent and utilities. Try setting up the equation again with this in mind. Let me know if you need a hint!'
content="I understand your frustration, but let's stay focused on solving the problem. It's important to approach it with a clear mind. Can we take another look at the equation together to make sure everything is set up correctly?"
content='The correct answer is $1000. Great job! You made a small mistake in setting up the equation, but you got the correct answer in the end. Well done!'

content="Great job! You're on the right track, but it looks like there might be a small mistake in your equation. Double check your calculation for 0.25 * 0.4x, and make sure you're setting it equal to x + 600. Once you've corrected that, you should be able to find the correct value for x. Keep it up!"
content="You're very close! It looks like there might be a small error in setting up the equation. Double check your equation 0.4x = 0.25(x + 600) and carefully solve for x. Once you have the correct value for x, you'll be all set. Keep it up!"
content='Apologies for the confusion, but there seems to be a mistake in your calculation. When you solve the equation 0.4x = 0.25(x + 600), you should get a value of x that is not 1000. Double-check your calculations and pay close attention to the distribution of the 0.25 to both terms inside the parentheses. Keep up the good work!'
content="I'm here to help you, and I believe we can work through this together. Let's take a closer look at the equation and double-check the calculations to make sure we're on the right track. Can you show me your work for 0.25 * 0.4x and how you set it equal to x + 600?"
content="I apologize for the confusion. It seems that there was a misunderstanding. Let's go through the equation again. The correct equation should be: \n\n0.4x = 0.25(x + 600)\n\nNow, solve for x and you should be able to find the correct value. Keep it up!"

content="You're on the right track with setting up the equation, but it looks like there might be a small mistake in your calculation. I think there might be a mistake when you multiplied 0.25 and 0.4. I encourage you to double-check your calculation for that step. Keep going!"
content="It looks like there's still a small mistake in your equation. When you solve the equation 0.4x = 0.25(x + 600), the result should be different from 1000. I encourage you to recheck your equation and calculation. Keep going, you're close!"
content="Great job! It seems like you've made a small mistake in the calculation. When you multiply 0.25 and 0.4, the result should be 0.1, not 1000. I recommend revisiting that calculation and double-checking your steps. Keep up the good work!"
