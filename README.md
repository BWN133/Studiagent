# Studiagent Chatbot

Studiagent is an educational chatbot that challenges users with mathematical problems sourced from the GSM8K dataset. It is designed to guide users through the problem-solving process and examines the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) in educational scenarios. There are two versions of Studiagent: a multi-agent version and a single-agent version, each designed to cater to different user needs and research interests.

## Overview

### Methodology

Studiagent operates in two configurations:
- **Multi-Agent Version**: Features a primary agent for logical processing, which identifies the problem context and determines the necessary actions, and a secondary agent that analyzes student responses to guide them effectively.
- **Single-Agent Version**: Integrates all functionalities into one agent, managing both the presentation of problems and the analysis of user responses.

Both versions are built on a consistent logical framework to ensure reliability and effectiveness in problem-solving assistance.
